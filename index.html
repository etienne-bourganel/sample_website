    As the title suggests, you have now landed on a webpage that is about <em>nothing</em>.
    It is certainly not of a great interest for you to browse such a webpage but some will argue that a few people would benefit from being here. As fo today we still ignore why.
    <br>
    By the way, this website is an exercise from the awesome <a href="https://www.learnenough.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong> <em> Learn Enough to Be Dangerous</em></strong></a> course.
    <br>

      <img class="image-link" src="./images/twitter_logo.png">
    </a>
    You should follow Learn Enough on Twitter
    <a href="https://twitter.com/learnenough" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.
  </p>
  </p>
  <h2>Welcome</h2>
  <p>Ok, since you are here anyway, let us welcome you. Not because we think you will gain anything from it bur rather because we want to express a little <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politeness" target="_blank"
      rel="noopener"><strong><em>politness</em></strong></a>.
    <br>
    So welcome to our webpage about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nothing" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>nothing</em></a>.
  </p>

  <h2>What to expect</h2>
  <p>
    By now you should have understood that not much is to be expected from this webpage.
  </p>

  <h3>Common misconceptions</h3>
  <p>
    We woukd not be surprised if despite the warnings mentionned here you would still expect anything from this webpage. We could mention <a
      href="https://users.cs.northwestern.edu/~ortony/Andrew_Ortony_files/1987%20-%20Surprise%20and%20expectation%20failure.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>this study from 1987 </em></a>but that would be mostly irrelevant to the context of
    this page.
  </p>

  <h3>Quotations</h3>

  <p>
    In addition to hosting most of the world's supply of kitten videos, the
    Web is also full of inspiring quotes, perhaps none more so than this one:
  </p>

  <blockquote style="padding: 2px 20px; background: #f7e08b;">
    <p>
      <em>Don't believe every quote you read on the Internet.</em>
      <br>
      â€”Abraham Lincoln
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <h3 id="other">Other stuff</h3>
  <p>
    Did you know that you can easily follow Elon Musk latest tweet <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>here</strong></a>?
    <br>No? Ok, well now you know.
