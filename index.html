      <p>
        As the title suggests, you have now landed on a webpage that is about <em>nothing</em>.
        It is certainly not of a great interest for yoyu to browse such a webpage but some will argue that a few people would benefit from being here. As fo today we still ignore why.
        <br>
        By the way, this website is an exercise from the awesome <a href="https://www.learnenough.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong> <em> Learn Enough to Be Dangerous</em></strong></a> course.
        <br>

            target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.
        </p>

    <h2>Welcome</h2>
      <p>Ok, since you are here anyway, let us welcome you here. Again, not because we thing you will gain anything from it bur rather because we want to express a little <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politeness" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><em>politness</em></strong></a>.
        <br>
      So welcome to our webpage about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nothing" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>nothing</em></a>.
      </p>

    <h2>What to expect</h2>
      <p>
          By now you should have understood that not much is to be expected from this webpage.
      </p>

    <h3>Common misconceptions</h3>
      <p>
        We woukd not be surprised if despite the warnings mentionned here you would still expect anything from this webpage. We could mention <a href="https://users.cs.northwestern.edu/~ortony/Andrew_Ortony_files/1987%20-%20Surprise%20and%20expectation%20failure.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>this study from 1987 </em></a>but that would be mostly irrelevant to the context of this page.
      </p>

    <h3>Other stuff</h3>
      <p>
        Did you know that you can easily follow Elon Musk latest tweet <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>here</strong></a>?
        <br>No? Ok, well now you know.
